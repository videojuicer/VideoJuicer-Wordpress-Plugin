A helper plugin to embed Video content hosted by Videojuicer 

== Description ==

Allowing you to quickly embed video content from [Videojuicer](http://www.videojuicer.com) into any 
wordpress page or post. 

You can configure the plug-in to show the video's meta data in the post ( where available ) , as 
well as default dimensions to display the video at and a default seed to use. 

The plugin also adds in the required meta data tags to support both open graph integration with facebook
and Oembed integration. 

## Usage

There is also a PDF visual start guide inside the folder. 

Inserting the content is a simple as inserting [videojuicer {presentation id}] in to the post / page body 
for example [videojuicer 16]. 

For convenience there is also a button on the editor that allows you to insert the shortcode.

You can setup other options in the shortcode to, ether by naming them of placing them in a certain order. 

**example**

[videojuicer {presentation id} {width} {height} {seed id}]

e.g [videojuicer 16 640 480]

or 

[videojuicer presentation={id} width={width} height={height} seed={seed}]

e.g [videojuicer presentation=16 width=640 height=480 seed=demo]
